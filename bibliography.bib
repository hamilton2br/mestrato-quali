The software was based on years of published academic research into advanced memory analysis and forensics. Up until that point, digital investigations had focused primarily on finding contraband within hard drive images. Volatility introduced people to the power of analyzing the runtime state of a system using the data found in volatile storage (RAM). It also provided a cross-platform, modular, and extensible platform to encourage further work into this exciting area of research. Another major goal of the project was to encourage the collaboration, innovation, and accessibility to knowledge that had been common within the offensive software communities.},

Rather than procure, deploy and manage a physical IT infrastructure to host their software applications, organizations are increasingly deploying their infrastructure into remote, virtualized environments, often hosted and managed by third parties. This development has significant implications for digital forensic investigators, equipment vendors, law enforcement, as well as corporate compliance and audit departments (among others). Much of digital forensic practice assumes careful control and management of IT assets (particularly data storage) during the conduct of an investigation. This paper summarises the key aspects of cloud computing and analyses how established digital forensic procedures will be invalidated in this new environment.

In the last decade computer forensics has developed in terms of procedures, practices and tool support to serve the law enforcement community.

@article{DykstraFROST:2013,
abstract = {We describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of FROST - three new forensic tools for the OpenStack cloud platform. Our implementation for the OpenStack cloud platform supports an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud and provides trustworthy forensic acquisition of virtual disks, API logs, and guest firewall logs. Unlike traditional acquisition tools, FROST works at the cloud management plane rather than interacting with the operating system inside the guest virtual machines, thereby requiring no trust in the guest machine. We assume trust in the cloud provider, but FROST overcomes non-trivial challenges of remote evidence integrity by storing log data in hash trees and returning evidence with cryptographic hashes. Our tools are user-driven, allowing customers, forensic examiners, and law enforcement to conduct investigations without necessitating interaction with the cloud provider. We demonstrate how FROST's new features enable forensic investigators to obtain forensically-sound data from OpenStack clouds independent of provider interaction. Our preliminary evaluation indicates the ability of our approach to scale in a dynamic cloud environment. The design supports an extensible set of forensic objectives, including the future addition of other data preservation, discovery, real-time monitoring, metrics, auditing, and acquisition capabilities. ?? 2013 Josiah Dykstra and Alan T.

Nowadays digital investigators face various technical, legal, and organizational challenges to keep up with current developments in the field of cloud computing.

The enormous available computing power can be leveraged to process massive amounts of information in order to extract relevant evidence.

The benefit for the reader of this paper is therefore a clear overview of the challenges and opportunities for scientific developments in the field of cloud forensics. As this paper represents an extended version of our paper presented at the ARES 2012 conference, we describe digital forensics investigations at the hypervisor level of virtualized environments in greater detail. cloud computing setups typically consist of several virtualized computer systems.

abstract = {The advent of cloud computing provides good opportunities for both good and malicious use. Cloud computing is at its infancy stage and its security is still an open research issue. Malicious users take advantage of the current lack of advanced security mechanisms in the cloud. Cloud computing paradigm enables users to access computing resources without necessarily owning physical infrastructures. It is therefore easy for an attacker who intends to perform malicious activities in the cloud to create a remotely hosted desktop, perform their activities and then destroy the desktop later. With the remotely hosted desktop destroyed, there is very little evidence left that can be collected by forensic experts using traditional static digital forensic methods. A scenario such as this therefore requires live digital forensic processes as a large amount of evidence can be gathered while the system is running. Key issues in cloud forensics include, but are not limited to, identity, encryption, and jurisdiction and data distribution. Digital forensic investigators currently face a challenge when criminal incidences occur as there are no well developed tools and procedures for conducting digital forensic investigations in the cloud. This paper proposes a novel framework that addresses issues of digital forensics in the cloud computing environment.},

This paper proposes a practical solution that can be implemented to mitigate the challenges with minimal to no CSP upkeep. Our model builds upon and adds to existing models and solutions including network monitoring for Infrastructure as a Service and snapshot capabilities to provide forensic evidence. We propose to utilize the automation of snapshots and an open-source tool, Google Rapid Response (GRR), set off by a hypervisor-based intrusion detection system in order to collect forensic evidence. Finally, we discuss the ideal implementation of our model and the future research direction.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is getting more and more attention from the information and communication technologies industry recently. Almost all the leading companies of the information area show their interesting and efforts on cloud computing and release services about cloud computing in succession. But if want to make it go further, we should pay more effort on security issues. Especially, the Internet environment now has become more and more unsecure. With the popularization of computers and intelligent devices, the number of crime on them has increased rapidly in last decades, and will be quicker on the cloud computing environment in future. No wall is wall in the world. We should enhance the cloud computing not only at the aspect of precaution, but also at the aspect of dealing with the security events to defend it from crime activities. In this paper, I propose a approach which using logs model to building a forensic-friendly system. Using this model we can quickly gather information from cloud computing for some kinds of forensic purpose. And this will decrease the complexity of those kinds of forensics. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

This is a result of the continuing development of storage technology, including increased storage capacity in consumer devices and cloud storage services, and an increase in the number of devices seized per case. Consequently, this has led to increasing backlogs of evidence awaiting analysis, often many months to years, affecting even the largest digital forensic laboratories. Over the preceding years, there has been a variety of research undertaken in relation to the volume challenge. Solutions posed range from data mining, data reduction, increased processing power, distributed processing, artificial intelligence, and other innovative methods. This paper surveys the published research and the proposed solutions. It is concluded that there remains a need for further research with a focus on real world applicability of a method or methods to address the digital forensic data volume challenge.},

First, we create a model to show the layers of trust required in the cloud. Second, we present the overarching context for a cloud forensic exam and analyze choices available to an examiner. Third, we provide for the first time an evaluation of popular forensic acquisition tools including Guidance EnCase and AccesData Forensic Toolkit, and show that they can successfully return volatile and non-volatile data from the cloud. We explain, however, that with those techniques judge and jury must accept a great deal of trust in the authenticity and integrity of the data from many layers of the cloud model. In addition, we explore four other solutions for acquisition - Trusted Platform Modules, the management plane, forensics-as-a-service, and legal solutions, which assume less trust but require more cooperation from the cloud service provider. Our work lays a foundation for future development of new acquisition methods for the cloud that will be trustworthy and forensically sound. Our work also helps forensic examiners, law enforcement, and the court evaluate confidence in evidence from the cloud. ?? 2012 Dykstra {\&} Sherman. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cloud Computing is arguably one of the most discussed information technologies today. It presents many promising technological and economical opportunities. However, many customers remain reluctant to move their business IT infrastructure completely to the cloud. One of their main concerns is Cloud Security and the threat of the unknown. Cloud Service Providers (CSP) encourage this perception by not letting their customers see what is behind their virtual curtain. A seldomly discussed, but in this regard highly relevant open issue is the ability to perform digital investigations. This continues to fuel insecurity on the sides of both providers and customers. Cloud Forensics constitutes a new and disruptive challenge for investigators. Due to the decentralized nature of data processing in the cloud, traditional approaches to evidence collection and recovery are no longer practical. This paper focuses on the technical aspects of digital forensics in distributed cloud environments. We contribute by assessing whether it is possible for the customer of cloud computing services to perform a traditional digital investigation from a technical point of view. Furthermore we discuss possible solutions and possible new methodologies helping customers to perform such investigations.},

Traditionally, the static analysis was used to investigate the digital incidents. But due to advancement in technology and the fact that hackers are developing malware that do not leave footprint on the hard disk, the need for performing live digital forensic analysis in addition to the static analysis has become imperative.
